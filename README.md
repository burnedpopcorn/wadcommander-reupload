# WAD Commander
### This Repository is a Re-Upload of WAD Commander (A Doom Launcher within the Browser)

Original Website is Here: https://wadcmd.com

My Mirror Site: (Not Currently Available)

### About Repository
I just did this because I could, and because I like Doom, and this website is in my opinion one of the best ways to play, 
but unfortunately this site has been blocked by some schools, so I decided to do something about it, and here's the result:
- An Exact Mirror of WAD Commander that is completely detached from the main website (just in case the main site goes down or is blocked)
> With the Exception of the Add to Home Screen Buttons
- With the Ability to Deploy to other Websites

And Sound does work, but the size of the music files can be a bit too much for some website providers, so you can remove them to save storage, but only sound effects will work after that
> The site without Music is about 62MB, and With Music is about 346MB

### Downloading and Self-Hosting
- Go to my Releases Page and download the package that best suits you
- Extract the files and place them into the root of your web server's storage
- Visit the Site by inputting the path to the index.html file (EX: https://example.com/index.html)
- Enjoy
> [!NOTE]
> I recommend not including the folder itself into the server's storage, as you will have to specify that in the URL (EX: https://example.com/{FOLDER NAME}/index.html)
>
> but if you have different websites within the same domain, then you should consider including the folder to not disrupt your exsisting website
