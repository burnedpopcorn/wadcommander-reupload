# WAD Commander
### This Repository is a Re-Upload of WAD Commander (A Doom Launcher within the Browser)

Original Website is Here: https://wadcmd.com

My Mirror Site: (Not Currently Available)

### About Repository
I just did this because I could, and because I like Doom, and this website is in my opinion one of the best ways to play, 
but unfortunately this site has been blocked by some schools, so I decided to do something about it, and here's the result:
- An Exact Mirror of WAD Commander that is completely detached from the main website (just in case the main site goes down or is blocked)
> With the Exception of the Add to Home Screen Buttons
- With the Ability to Deploy to other Websites

And Sound does work, but the size of the music files can be a bit too much for some website providers, so you can remove them to save storage, but only sound effects will work after that
> The site without Music is about 62MB, and With Music is about 346MB

### Credits
Thanks to
- WAD Commander for the Doom Web Launcher
- The Wayback Machine
That's it

Also check out Adam's modified (and frankly cleaner) version of this Website [Here](https://github.com/Adam-S-Amir/WadCMD)
> [!NOTE]
> These projects were made completely seperate from each other, and have no connection what so ever, I'm just mentioning a possible better option for some
